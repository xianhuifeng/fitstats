See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the latest software releases and changes.

FitStats is built using the [AngularJS Full-Stack Generator v2.0.4](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack)

These are the generator parameters selected for FitStats:
####Client
- vanilla JS
- HTML markup
- CSS stylesheets
- angular ui-router

####Server
- MongoDB database (w/mongoose DRM)
- Authentication Boilerplate: Yes
- oAuth integrations: Facebook
- Socket.io integration: No



### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
sudo npm install -g bower
npm install
bower install
#google-chart dependency will ask for Angular 1.3.x.
#Ignore it and use Angular 1.2.x instead.
```

### Environment Variables
Keeping your app secrets and other sensitive information in source control isn't a good idea. To have grunt launch your app with specific environment variables, add them to the git ignored environment config file: `server/config/local.env.js`.

### [Injection](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack#injection)

### [Generators](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack#generators)

### [Project Structure](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack#project-structure)

### [Testing](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack/blob/master/readme.md#testing)
To run your local version of the app, do the following:
```sh
mongod #Mongo must be running
grunt serve
```

`grunt serve` will monitor your files for changes, but will not inject any new
dependencies (css files, js files, etc) into index.html for you. In order for them
to be added, you'll have to quit the process (Ctrl+C) and run `grunt serve` again.
